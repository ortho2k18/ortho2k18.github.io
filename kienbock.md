# Kienbock's Disease
**Osteonecrosis of the Lunate**, possibly due to chronic stress or injury.  
Associated with **Negative ulnar variance** – relative shortening of the ulna- causes stress overload (not yet proven)  

## Clinical features 

Typically occurs in **young adult men, in the dominant hand**  
Ache and stiffness  
**Decreased grip strength**  
Tenderness localized over the lunate  
Later stages – limited and painful wrist movements  

## Stages (Lichtman)

1.	Ischemia, no X Ray changes, visible on MRI
2.	Trabecular necrosis, reactive new bone and increased density  (Sclerosis seen on Xray)
3.	
 a.	Fragmented Lunate, height preserved  
 b.	**Collapse** of bone  
4.	Radiocarpal congruence disrupted, Secondary **osteoarthritis**  

## Management

Initially, **Splintage of wrist** – for 6 to 12 weeks – reduces pain and also stress  
If there is **flattening** of the bone / Pain persists – surgical treatment
1.	Before collapse of bone -  **revascularise** – pedicled bone graft / vascular bundle implantation 
2.	Or can reduce the stress on the lunate (while the wrist architecture is only mildly distorted)
-	**Shortening the radius**
-	Shortening of capitulum
-	(If ulnar variance neutral) – tilt the radius radially

If has collapsed
- Wrist neurectomy – reduce pain, while preserving movement
- Lunate prosthesis – poor outcome – particle shedding – synovitis
- scaphocapitate fusion , scapho-trapezio-trapezoid arthrodesis,  excision of the proximal row of the carpus (may not prevent osteoarthritis)
- For intolerable pain and severely limited movement – radiocarpal arthodesis – stable and pain free wrist
- Wrist replacement surgery

## DDs
1.	**ulnar impaction syndrome**  (sclerosis/signal change is at the proximal ulnar aspect of lunate, positive ulnar variance, ulnar head impacts on the carpal bones).
2.	**Preiser’s disease** (scaphoid undergoes spontaneous avascular necrosis).
